# GitHub Setup and Deployment Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a GitHub repository for the Mill Test Certificate Analyzer and pushing your code to it.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account
- Mill Test Certificate Analyzer code ready for deployment

## Setting Up a New GitHub Repository

1. **Login to GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account

2. **Create a New Repository**
   - Click on the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., "mill-test-certificate-analyzer")
   - Add a description (optional)
   - Choose whether the repository should be public or private
   - Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the Repository URL**
   - After creating the repository, you'll see instructions for setting up your repository
   - Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL for your repository (looks like `https://github.com/username/mill-test-certificate-analyzer.git`)

## Initializing Your Local Repository

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Navigate to your project directory
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/mill-test-certificate-analyzer
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already initialized)
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add Your Files to the Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Your Files**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Mill Test Certificate Analyzer"
   ```

5. **Connect to the Remote Repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/mill-test-certificate-analyzer.git
   ```
   Replace the URL with the one you copied in step 3 of the previous section.

6. **Push Your Code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Note: If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Updating Your Repository

After making changes to your code, follow these steps to update your GitHub repository:

1. **Stage the Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes made"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Branch Management (Optional)

If you want to work on new features without affecting the main codebase:

1. **Create a New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

3. **Push the Branch to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

4. **Merge with Main Branch** (when the feature is complete)
   First, switch back to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   Then merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/new-feature-name
   ```
   Finally, push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Setting Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

GitHub Actions can be used to automatically test and deploy your application. To set this up:

1. **Create a Workflows Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Create a Workflow File**
   Create a file named `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Mill Test Certificate Analyzer CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: '3.9'
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install flake8 pytest
           if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
       - name: Lint with flake8
         run: |
           # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
           flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
       - name: Test with pytest
         run: |
           pytest
   ```

3. **Commit and Push the Workflow File**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/python-app.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push
   ```

## Protecting Your Sensitive Data

1. **Never commit sensitive information**
   - API keys, passwords, etc. should be stored in environment variables or .env files
   - Make sure .env is listed in your .gitignore file

2. **Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret"
   - Add any necessary secrets (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)
   - Reference these secrets in your GitHub Actions workflow files

## Additional GitHub Features to Consider

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks
- **Projects**: Set up a project board to organize and prioritize your work
- **Wiki**: Create documentation for your project using the Wiki feature
- **GitHub Pages**: Host a documentation website using GitHub Pages
- **Discussions**: Enable Discussions for community engagement

## Keeping Your Repository Up to Date

1. **Pull before making changes**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. **Resolve any conflicts** if they arise

3. **Make your changes, commit, and push**

By following these instructions, you'll have successfully set up a GitHub repository for your Mill Test Certificate Analyzer project and established a workflow for keeping it updated.
